# Coursera Algorithms Specializaiton

This repository contains code I wrote while completing the Coursera Algorithms Specialization by Stanford University. The structure of the repository mirrors the structure of the course, in that it is broken into four subdirectories, each of which corresponds to one of the four-week courses in the specializaiton:

- Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
- Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
- Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
- Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them

In addition to the scripts I wrote as part of the homework assignments for the course, the directories also contain the data files used in each of the assignments.
